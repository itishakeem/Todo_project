# Project Constitution

This document outlines the core principles and guidelines for the todo-evolution project.

## Guiding Principles

- **Iterative Development:** We will build the project in phases, delivering value incrementally.
- **Modularity:** Components will be designed to be loosely coupled and independently deployable.
- **Automation:** We will leverage automation for testing, deployment, and infrastructure management.
- **Security:** Security will be a first-class concern throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Observability:** The system will be designed with comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing.
