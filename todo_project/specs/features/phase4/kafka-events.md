# Feature: Kafka Events

## Description

This feature involves integrating Kafka for asynchronous event-driven communication between services.

## Goals

- Set up Kafka (or a Kafka-compatible system like Redpanda) for event streaming.
- Implement services to publish events to Kafka topics.
- Implement services to consume events from Kafka topics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Kafka is operational and accessible.
- Events are reliably published and consumed between services.
