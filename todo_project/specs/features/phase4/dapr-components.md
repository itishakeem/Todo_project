# Feature: Dapr Components Integration

## Description

This feature focuses on integrating Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) components to manage state, messaging, and bindings.

## Goals

- Configure and utilize Dapr components for state management.
- Implement Dapr for inter-service communication (e.g., pub/sub).
- Set up Dapr for external event handling (e.g., cron bindings).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dapr components for state, pub/sub, and bindings are correctly configured and functional.
- Services successfully leverage Dapr for communication and state persistence.
