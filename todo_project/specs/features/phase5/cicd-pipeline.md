# Feature: CI/CD Pipeline

## Description

This feature involves setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated building, testing, and deployment.

## Goals

- Automate the build process upon code changes.
- Implement automated testing within the pipeline.
- Automate the deployment of new versions to different environments (e.g., staging, production).

## Acceptance Criteria

- The CI/CD pipeline is successfully configured and operational.
- Code changes trigger automated builds and tests.
- Deployments are automated based on pipeline stages.
